# Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

This project aims to predict stock market prices using a combination of numerical analysis and sentiment analysis of news headlines. It leverages time series analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on historical stock data and news sentiment.

This project is a part of The Sparks Foundation GRIP internship which highlights time series analysis of historical stock prices and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
The historical stock prices dataset have been taken from https://finance.yahoo.com/ and the news headlines data is used from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6.

I have used Auto-ARIMA model to make stock market prices predictions using the historical stock prices data. In the sentiment analysis model, I have made use of different machine learning algorithms-Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM, Adaboost and Xgboost- to make the predictions.

## Steps Involved

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data quality. The 'pandas' library is used for this purpose.

### Numerical Analysis
Various numerical indicators are calculated to understand market trends, including moving averages, standard deviations, and returns. These indicators provide insights into the historical performance of the stock.

### Textual Analysis
Sentiment analysis is performed on news headlines to gauge market sentiment. The 'NLTK' library is used for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.

### Modeling
Machine learning models, including random forest regressor, AdaBoost regressor, XGBoost, and LightGBM, are applied to predict stock market prices based on historical data and sentiment scores.

### Results
The results of the stock market price predictions are presented and analyzed. Visualizations may include time series plots, prediction accuracy, and other relevant metrics.
